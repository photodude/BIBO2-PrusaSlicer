0.0.3 Removed obsolete host keys
min_slic3r_version = 2.2.0-alpha5
0.0.2-beta1 Fixes the first layer temp for ditto printing. Re-impliments the new conditional output naming convention as Prusaslicer 2.2.0 has been released. Moved this to 0.0.2-beta1 to remove conflicts with v0.0.1 included in PrusaSlicer 2.2.0

0.0.1-beta3 Multiple Print models were unified into a single one. Other improvements were adopted from the changes PrusaSlicer made to their version of this profile.
0.0.1-beta2 Bed model and textures added. Materials all use the BOBO2 identifier. deretract speed set to 0 to use retract speed.
0.0.1-beta1 Added new printer profiles for ditto printing. New retraction settings, new materials. Removed some settings which do not apply. More start gcode improvements.
0.0.1-alpha13 Adjusted Jerk, Acceleration, and maximum feedrates to better match the stock firmware. For Dual extrusion, tool change retractions were increased.
0.0.1-alpha12 github repo created for version history
0.0.1-alpha11 Revised version available to community for testing. Removed PVA and HIPS disolvable support materials from single extruder versions. Improved single extruder second nozzle standby temperature
0.0.1-alpha8 Available to community Early adopters for testing. Corrected filament settings to prevent duplicates, and reworked start and end gcode.
